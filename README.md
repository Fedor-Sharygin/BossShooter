UE4 project - FPS shooter with 3 different levels and bosses.

**_03/27/2023_**
> Sphere Boss Arena is created and Blueprint based movement is defined

**_03/29/2023_**
> Started Boss Sphere C++ based behavior class. Started immigrating FPS movement to C++ for ease of use

**_03/31/2023_**
> Boss Sphere movement behaviors are set. Started working on custom AIBossSphereController to allow Behavior Tree use

**_04/01/2023_**
> AIBossSphereController implemented and Full HP behavior defined.

**_04/06/2023_**
> Added texture and materials for Sphere Boss and Floor, and let the Sphere Boss to freely rotate independently from Movement Component
> Started work on Gun Components to be used in Gun Actors. Added Boss HP component, so when creating future bosses, no new additions to gun behaviors would need to be added
